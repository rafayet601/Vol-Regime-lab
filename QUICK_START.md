## 🎯 What Can You Do With This?

### 1. Portfolio Risk Management
```python
from regime_lab.models.hmm_studentt import StudentTHMM
from regime_lab.data.loader import load_spx_data

# Load recent data
price_data, returns_data = load_spx_data(start_date="2020-01-01")

# Train model
model = StudentTHMM(n_states=2, n_features=2, df=5.0)
model.fit(X_features)

# Get current regime
current_regime = model.predict_states(latest_features)

if current_regime == 1:  # High volatility
    print("⚠️  Risk-off: Reduce equity exposure")
else:
    print("✅ Risk-on: Normal allocation")
```

### 2. Trading Signal Generation
- **Regime switches** can signal entry/exit points
- **State probabilities** provide confidence levels
- **Transition matrix** shows regime persistence

### 3. Backtesting Strategies
- Test strategies conditional on regime
- Optimize parameters per regime
- Evaluate regime-specific performance

### 4. Risk Analysis
- VaR/CVaR estimates by regime
- Stress testing scenarios
- Drawdown analysis

## 🎓 Key Features

### 1. Custom Baum-Welch Implementation
- No dependency on pomegranate's API changes
- Pure NumPy/SciPy implementation
- Fully transparent and customizable

### 2. Student-t Emissions
- Fat-tail modeling for financial returns
- Better captures extreme events
- Degrees of freedom = 5.0 (configurable)

### 3. Diagonal Covariance
- Assumes feature independence
- Faster computation
- Still captures regime differences

### 4. Robust Feature Engineering
- Rolling volatility (annualized)
- Absolute returns (volatility clustering)
- Z-score normalization
- Extensible framework

## 📊 Model Parameters

### Learned Transition Matrix
```
From State 0 → State 0: 0.589 (stay in high vol)
From State 0 → State 1: 0.411 (switch to low vol)
From State 1 → State 0: 0.280 (switch to high vol)
From State 1 → State 1: 0.720 (stay in low vol)
```

**Interpretation**: Low volatility regime is stickier (72% vs 59%)

### Emission Parameters
- **State 0**: High volatility, high abs returns
- **State 1**: Low volatility, low abs returns

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Extend to More States
```python
model = StudentTHMM(n_states=3)  # Add medium volatility regime
```

### 2. Add More Features
```python
features = ['rolling_std', 'abs_returns', 'skewness', 'kurtosis']
```

### 3. Multi-Asset Analysis
```python
# Fit regime model per asset
spy_model = StudentTHMM().fit(spy_features)
qqq_model = StudentTHMM().fit(qqq_features)

# Compare regime alignment
correlation = np.corrcoef(spy_states, qqq_states)
```

### 4. Real-time Deployment
```python
# Update model with new data
latest_data = loader.load_data(end_date="today")
current_regime = model.predict_states(latest_features)

# Send alert
if current_regime != previous_regime:
    send_alert(f"Regime change detected: {previous_regime} → {current_regime}")
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Algorithm: Expectation-Maximization (Baum-Welch)
1. **Initialization**: K-means clustering
2. **E-step**: Compute state responsibilities
3. **M-step**: Update parameters (means, scales, transitions)
4. **Convergence**: Check log-likelihood improvement

### Complexity
- Time: O(T × K² × D) per iteration
  - T = number of observations
  - K = number of states
  - D = number of features
- Space: O(T × K)

### Numerical Stability
- Log-space computations
- Minimum scale values (1e-6)
- Normalized probabilities
